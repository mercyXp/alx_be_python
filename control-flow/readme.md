# Exercises

This repository contains a series of Python exercises focused on control flow concepts including conditional statements, loops, and pattern matching.

## Exercises

### 1. Weather Recommendation Program
**File:** `weather_advice.py`  
- Prompts user for current weather (sunny/rainy/cold)
- Provides appropriate clothing recommendations
- Handles unexpected inputs gracefully

### 2. Simple Calculator with Match Case  
**File:** `match_case_calculator.py`  
- Takes two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) as input
- Uses `match-case` to perform calculations
- Handles division by zero error

### 3. Multiplication Table Generator  
**File:** `multiplication_table.py`  
- Takes a number as input
- Generates and prints multiplication table from 1 to 10
- Demonstrates `for` loop usage

### 4. Drawing Patterns with Nested Loops  
**File:** `pattern_drawing.py`  
- Takes a size input (positive integer)
- Uses nested loops to print a square pattern of asterisks
- Combines `while` and `for` loops

### 5. Personal Daily Reminder  
**File:** `daily_reminder.py`  
- Takes task description, priority, and time-sensitivity as input
- Uses `match-case` and conditionals to generate customized reminders
- Provides different messages based on priority and urgency

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `control-flow` directory
3. Run any script with Python 3.10+ (required for match-case support)

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python syntax

These exercises help reinforce fundamental programming concepts through practical applications.
